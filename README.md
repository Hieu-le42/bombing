Born and raised in Vietnam, a country steeped in over 4,000 years of rich history, I developed a profound love for its past.
                While traditional history often focuses on stories and figures, I sought to gain new insights and understanding through the lens of data.
                This blend of historical passion and data-driven inquiry has fueled this personal project!
